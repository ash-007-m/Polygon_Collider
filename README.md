# Polygon Collider Visualizer
A javascrpit program that utilizes three.js for graphical interface and GJK algorithim to detect 
the collision between two 3D convex  polygon, the GJK algo is so powerful that is you only need 
the vertices to two polygon to check the collision.

The code contains GJK for 3D polygons (any number of sides) with an exmple of two 3D polygon (cube and a cuboid) collision.
